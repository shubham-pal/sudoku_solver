Solving Sudoku using Constraint Satisfaction Search

For a sudoku board of 9*9

Variables : 
Rows are indexed alphabetically starting with {A, B,C, D.. and so on.}
Columns are indexed by digits starting with {1,2,3,4.. and so on.}
For 9*9 sudoku boards, variables are {A1, A2…A9, B1,B2,..., I1,I2,...I9.}
At max 81 variables can be present.

Domain : 
For each variable, the value lies b/w [1,9]

Constraints : 
Each row consists of 9 distinct values ∈ [1,9].
I.e. <(A1,A2..A9), (all should be distinct )> and so on.
Each column consists of 9 distinct values ∈ [1,9].
I.e. <(A1,B1,...,I1), (all should be distinct)>
For each 3*3 blocks (no overlapping blocks) starting from A1 cell, consists of the 9 distinct values ∈ [1,9].
I.e. <(A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3), (all should be distinct)>


Methodology: (using backtracking)
Start with the first cell (in first column and first row) and if it is not filled then assign a value (from 1 to 9) to it and then check for constrains in row, column and block.
If constraints violates then backtrack and assign another value.
In the same manner we try to assign values to all the cells until all cells are filled or a constraint violation has taken place.
In case of a constraint violation we backtrack and try to assign other values.
We keep on repeating these steps until all the cells are filled.



Generalization 
For sudoku of sizes 16*16, 25*25, 36*36, n*n in general

We would need to assume n as a perfect square for making smaller blocks,
Let m = sqrt(n)

Variables will increase depending on the board size ( Number of variable =  n*n - #(given values) )
At max n*n variables can be present.

Domain for each cell will become [1,n]


Constraints : 
For each row we need distinct values for each cell ∈ [1,n]
For each column we need distinct values for each cell ∈ [1,n]
For each block of m*m we need distinct values for each cell ∈ [1,n]

Methodology will be the same as previous.
